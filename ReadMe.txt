Date: 05/17/2024 -> Update 1
In an attempt to increse the models accuracy I decided to try another
archetecture structure to train the model. This started to produce amazing results.
That was until I found a bug in the code (I also took the oprotunity to redesine the flow of
the code to make it more scalable for future changes) and since the bug has been resulved the
output of the program is less exciting. I plan on continuing to play with this new archetecure
to see what other changes can be made for it to better fit the data.

Date: 06/06/2024  -> Update 2

I have exausted all my known techneques to fit the data to the model.
My most recent change was attempting to use the total scores of the people instead
of their indivisual scores. I tried feeding the data raw into the network along with clustering and
normalization teccheques. Nothing seemed to work. I think the data set may be too small
to draw any reliable conclusions and the bigger data set is needed to move forward.
With the spare time because I do not have the larger data set I took the needed oprotunity
to completly re-organize the code and all of the files. Now the code is more understandable
and well organized and most imortantly, it is scalable. So when I do obtain the larger data set it
should be a near flawless transition into my current code.
Moving forward until I get the larger data set my plan is to do online reaserch about
phycology and what more of the metrics mean so I can have a better understanding of what
I am doing other than just dealing with numbers and that could hold the key to solving the problem.
