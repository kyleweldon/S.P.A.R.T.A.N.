In an attempt to increse the models accuracy I decided to try another
archetecture structure to train the model. This started to produce amazing results.
That was until I found a bug in the code (I also took the oprotunity to redesine the flow of
the code to make it more scalable for future changes) and since the bug has been resulved the
output of the program is less exciting. I plan on continuing to play with this new archetecure
to see what other changes can be made for it to better fit the data.
